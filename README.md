This project is a small attempt to organize medical prescriptions and records in one place
I started this because managing my mother’s long-term medical history across papers and photos was difficult
Right now, the backend can save and fetch prescriptions using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
More features like reports and a  frontend will be added gradually.
